# Accounting Distribution System

**Version 0.1**

This project is a Next.js based application for managing products, distribution centers, inventory and sales. It requires a PostgreSQL database and Redis for caching.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (installed globally)
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- (Optional for production) PM2 and Nginx

## Quick start on Debian

If you are running Debian 12 you can use the automated installer:

```bash
sudo bash install-debian.sh
```

The script installs all dependencies, clones the repository, downloads the **Tajawal** font using `download-fonts.sh` and runs `setup-all.sh` to configure the system. The font files are fetched from the [Google Fonts GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/tajawal) by default. You can override the URL by setting the `FONT_BASE_URL` environment variable before running the script. You can also override other defaults by exporting variables, e.g.:

```bash
export APP_USER=myuser
export APP_DIR=/opt/accounting-system
export DB_USER=accounting
export DB_NAME=accounting_db
export DB_PASSWORD=secret
export REPO_URL=https://github.com/naturae-syria/Accounting.git
sudo bash install-debian.sh
```

Temporary files generated during installation are automatically removed by
`cleanup-temp.sh` which runs at the end of the installer.

## Manual setup

1. Install Node.js, pnpm, PostgreSQL and Redis on your machine.
2. Clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Download the Tajawal fonts (from GitHub by default):

```bash
./download-fonts.sh
```
You can set `FONT_BASE_URL` if you want to use an alternate download source.

4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or export the variables in your shell) and update the values as needed:

```env
DB_USER=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=accounting_system
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_PORT=5432
# Alternatively you can use a single connection string
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/accounting_system
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

5. Initialize the database:

```bash
pnpm run init-db
```

6. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

For production build and start:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```
By default the server listens on port 3000. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser (or replace `localhost` with your server's IP or domain).
If you define the `NEXT_BASE_PATH` environment variable when building, append that path to the URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000$NEXT_BASE_PATH`).

## Development

Run `pnpm install` before executing any lint checks:

```bash
pnpm install
npm run lint
```

The CI workflow also runs `pnpm install` before `npm run lint` to ensure dependencies are present.

## Using Docker

The repository includes a `docker-compose.yml` file for running the application
and its dependencies in containers.

1. **Configure environment variables** â€“ copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit
   the values for your setup.
2. **Build the images**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Start the stack and initialize the database** by running the helper
   script:

   ```bash
   ./run-docker.sh
   ```

   The script waits for PostgreSQL to be ready and then runs the database
   initializer before bringing the app online. Access it via
   `http://localhost`.

4. **View logs and troubleshoot** container issues:

   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f         # Follow service logs
   docker-compose ps              # Check container status
   ```

   If a container fails to start you can inspect it with
   `docker-compose logs <service>` or restart it using `docker-compose
   restart <service>`.

5. **Stop the services** when finished:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

For a completely automated installation that clones the repository's `docker` branch and sets up Docker with all dependencies, run:

```bash
bash install-docker-e2e.sh
```

This script ensures Docker is installed, pulls the repository and starts the containers using `run-docker.sh`.


## Custom reports

The dashboard includes a **Custom Reports** tab where you can define your own reports. Choose a report type, enter a name and comma separated columns, then add the report. Reports can be removed from the same tab. They are stored in the database via `/api/custom-reports`.

## Managing the application

For production deployments the application can be managed using **PM2**. After running `setup-pm2.sh` an `ecosystem.config.js` file is generated and the app is registered with the name `accounting-system`.
The `setup-all.sh` script also installs a helper command named `NexAccount` in `/usr/local/bin` to make management easier.
This command runs from `/var/www/accounting-system`, so you can invoke `NexAccount` anywhere on the system.

Run `NexAccount help` to display a summary of all available commands.

- **Start** the application

  ```bash
  NexAccount Start
  ```

- **Stop** the application

  ```bash
  NexAccount Stop
  ```

- **Restart** the application

  ```bash
  NexAccount Restart
  ```

- **Check status**

  ```bash
  NexAccount Status
  ```

Each of the `Start`, `Restart` and `Status` commands prints the current
service state along with the URLs for accessing the application.

- **Update** the application

  ```bash
  NexAccount Update
  ```

- **Delete** the PM2 process

  ```bash
  NexAccount Delete
  ```

- **View service logs**

  ```bash
  NexAccount Log
  ```

- **Help**

  ```bash
  NexAccount help
  ```

### Accessing the application

After running `setup-all.sh`, the install summary shows whether HTTPS was enabled. By default the site is available at:

- **HTTP**: `http://<your-domain-or-ip>` on port **80**
- **HTTPS**: `https://<your-domain-or-ip>` on port **443`** (when SSL is enabled)
- **Direct**: `http://<your-domain-or-ip>:3000` if Nginx is not configured or port 80 shows the default page.
Nginx must be configured using `setup-nginx.sh` (or via `setup-all.sh`) for ports 80 and 443 to serve the app.

### Service logs

Logs for the major components can be found in the following locations:

- **Nginx**: `/var/log/nginx/`
- **PM2/Application**: `~/.pm2/logs/`
- **PostgreSQL**: `/var/log/postgresql/`
- **Fail2Ban**: `/var/log/fail2ban.log`
- **UFW firewall**: `/var/log/ufw.log`

### Firewall

`setup-firewall.sh` configures UFW to open ports 22, 80, 443, 3000, 5432, 6379, 9090 and 9100 so the project operates correctly.
